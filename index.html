      Sprite Animations
      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      to be able to animate correctly in "fnf ae" there are certain things to follow:
      the indexbases are so to speak "keynames" which predetermine which movement of the sprite
      
      character name + indexbase + frame(number)
      
      example: "bf_up2"
      // bf (name), _up (indexbase), 2 (frame)
      
      the indexbase for the enemy character are:
      _idle
      _left
      _down
      _up
      _right
      _pose
      
      for the player character they are the same indexbase but with more additions:
      _leftfail
      _downfail
      _upfail
      _rightfail
      _pose
     
      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      Basic Charting
      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      in the charting part there are 3 types of objects
      - arrows // {key,side,holdnote,delay}
      - cameras // {"#cam",delay} or {"#customCam",X,Y,delay}
      - events // {"@example","string",delay}
      
      ## arrows
      // Key
      - 1 | left-key
      - 2 | downkey
      - 3 | up key
      - 4 | right key
      // side
      - 0 | the arrow will go to the player
      - 1 | the arrow will go to the enemy
      - 2 | the arrow will go to both
      - 3 | the arrow will go to both but the player's arrow will go the other way, example:
      - current enemy arrow: 1
      - player current arrow: 4 (opposite)
      // hold note
      it is for how long you want it to have to be pressed after touching the arrow (it is measured in quantity not in duration)
      
      // delay
      when the arrow has to appear (it is not measured in milliseconds like in other fnf engines like kade, psych or modding+)
      
      ## cameras
      -/ Default cameras /-
      // "#camIn"
      the camera will focus on the player
      // "#camOut"
      the camera will focus on the enemy
      // "#camMid"
      the camera will be between the player and the enemy (basically 0x, 0y)
      
      ------------------
      // delay
      It is also the same as with the arrows, it is not measured in milliseconds
      
      -/Customizable camera/-
      
      This is a bit different from the default ones since in this one to let the "chartHandler" know that it is a camera that is going to point to a different side than the defaults (for example, outside the map) you have to use this: "#camCustom "
      There will also be extra parameters like "x" and "y" (positions) next to the "delay" (I don't want to repeat what it is anymore)
      
      ## events
      in this the same modder will have to add the events that he wants in his chart by directly modifying the game code.
      the same there are already predetermined events to facilitate said function
      
      // "@example"
      in this instead of "@example" the following events could go
      
      - "@changeskinbot" | change the enemy sprite
      - "@changeskinplr" | change player sprite
      - "@changeskingf" | change the girlfriend sprite (this one doesn't work.)
      - "@bindable" | you send the "string"
      
      // "string"
      this is an attribute for events
      if it is a "changeskin" it will act as a sprite name, if it is a "bindable" it will act as a message to the game to execute a function
      
      ## Here is an example chart
    {{"@changeskinbot","skin",0},{"#camOut",0},{3,0,1,0},{3,0,1,0.1875},{"@bindable","Player_Pose",12}}
