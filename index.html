      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
      Sprite Animations<br>
      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
      to be able to animate correctly in "fnf ae" there are certain things to follow:<br>
      the indexbases are so to speak "keynames" which predetermine which movement of the sprite<br>
      <br>
      character name + indexbase + frame(number)<br>
      <br>
      example: "bf_up2"<br>
      // bf (name), _up (indexbase), 2 (frame)<br>
      <br>
      the indexbase for the enemy character are:<br>
      _idle<br>
      _left<br>
      _down<br>
      _up<br>
      _right<br>
      _pose<br>
      <br>
      for the player character they are the same indexbase but with more additions:<br>
      _leftfail<br>
      _downfail<br>
      _upfail<br>
      _rightfail<br>
      _pose<br>
     <br>
      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
      Basic Charting<br>
      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
      in the charting part there are 3 types of objects<br>
      - arrows // {key,side,holdnote,delay}<br>
      - cameras // {"#cam",delay} or {"#customCam",X,Y,delay}<br>
      - events // {"@example","string",delay}<br>
      <br>
      ## arrows<br>
      // Key<br>
      - 1 | left-key<br>
      - 2 | downkey<br>
      - 3 | up key<br>
      - 4 | right key<br>
      // side<br>
      - 0 | the arrow will go to the player<br>
      - 1 | the arrow will go to the enemy<br>
      - 2 | the arrow will go to both<br>
      - 3 | the arrow will go to both but the player's arrow will go the other way, example:<br>
      - current enemy arrow: 1<br>
      - player current arrow: 4 (opposite)<br>
      // hold note<br>
      it is for how long you want it to have to be pressed after touching the arrow (it is measured in quantity not in duration)<br>
      <br>
      // delay<br>
      when the arrow has to appear (it is not measured in milliseconds like in other fnf engines like kade, psych or modding+)<br>
      <br>
      ## cameras<br>
      -/ Default cameras /-<br>
      // "#camIn"<br>
      the camera will focus on the player<br>
      // "#camOut"<br>
      the camera will focus on the enemy<br>
      // "#camMid"<br>
      the camera will be between the player and the enemy (basically 0x, 0y)<br>
      <br>
      ------------------<br>
      // delay<br>
      It is also the same as with the arrows, it is not measured in milliseconds<br>
      <br>
      -/Customizable camera/-<br>
      <br>
      This is a bit different from the default ones since in this one to let the "chartHandler" know that it is a camera that is going to point to a different side than the defaults (for example, outside the map) you have to use this: "#camCustom"<br>
      There will also be extra parameters like "x" and "y" (positions) next to the "delay" (I don't want to repeat what it is anymore)<br>
      <br>
      ## events<br>
      in this the same modder will have to add the events that he wants in his chart by directly modifying the game code.<br>
      the same there are already predetermined events to facilitate said function<br>
      <br>
      // "@example"<br>
      in this instead of "@example" the following events could go<br>
      <br>
      - "@changeskinbot" | change the enemy sprite<br>
      - "@changeskinplr" | change player sprite<br>
      - "@changeskingf" | change the girlfriend sprite (this one doesn't work.)<br>
      - "@bindable" | you send the "string"<br>
      <br>
      // "string"<br>
      this is an attribute for events<br>
      if it is a "changeskin" it will act as a sprite name, if it is a "bindable" it will act as a message to the game to execute a function<br>
      <br>
      ## Here is an example chart
     </p>
    {{"@changeskinbot","skin",0},{"#camOut",0},{3,0,1,0},{3,0,1,0.1875},{"@bindable","Player_Pose",12}}
